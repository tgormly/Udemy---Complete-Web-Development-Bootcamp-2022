            <h3>Speaking Spanish</h3>
            <p class="spanish-skill-description">Over the last several years, Tim has dedicated a small piece of his day to learning to speak Spanish.  Duolingo has been primary source of Tim's Spanish education. Dreaming Spanish, a web-site dedicated to creating educational Spanish videos mean to be used to improve students' listening skills, has also been instrumental in Tim's education.  While he is nowhere near fluency right now, Tim hopes to be truly bilingual someday! </p>

            <h3>Cooking</h3>
            <p class="cooking-skill-description">For many years, Tim adhered to the Keto diet, in pursuit of weight loss.  This was possible until Tim entered a relationship with a wonderful girl with a wonderful family full of wonderful cooks, who love nothing more than to see their food enjoyed by their guests.  You don't look a gift horse in the mouth, and you don't tell your girlfriend's family "Thank you, but no thank you.  I don't eat carbs.  I'll take mine without rice, thanks".  Anyway, while Tim was on the Keto diet, he had to learn how to cook, as too many preconstructed foods have entirely too many carbs.</p>
